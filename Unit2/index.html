<h1>Luisa's Unit 2 project</h1>

<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>

<p> First website is <a href="http://www.risotteriamelottinyc.com">Risotteria Melotti</a> </p>
<p> Second website is <a href="http://<p> <a href="http://www.wearefine.com>FINE Design Group</a> </p>


<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>

<p>First Website.... The main focal point is created by a full screen image of the end product. The dish is where the eye is naturally drawn to by blurring out the outer edges of the photo and while the brand and interactive link are in the center. Despite being centered they are not contrasting with the background so your eyes go to this second. The high quality food photography makes the user want to eat the dish it looks so good and makes me curious about what the next step is behind the inviting interactive play button in the middle of the screen.</p>

<p>Second Website "FINE Design Group" There are things that I like about this site and some things I don't like. I like the use of high quality images and screenshots of their works but perhaps there are too many images that feels like overstimulation and my eye doesn't seem to be able to find a natural flow of progression.</p>

<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>

<p> They both use images that create a curiousity in the user which infuences them to continue navigating the site further. Neither seems to use much of white space.

Risotto Melotti does not uses out-of-focus techniques to direct the user's eye. The close ups and different angles in the video create an intimate perspective of the draw of of farm-to-table dining.
<br><br>
FINE Design Group doesn't use these focus techniques to direct the users eye which I feel can make the user feel a little overwhelmed. But they also have alot of amazing works to showcase.</p>

<p> The landing page "HOME" creates a main focal point using a revolving set of screenshots of products/services/ads. The user can navigate either by using the animated navigation bar at the top of the page or text navigation at the bottom or on the revolving screen itself.</p>
