	<h1>Luisa's Unit 2 project</h1>

	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p> First website is <a href="http://www.risotteriamelottinyc.com" target="_blank">Risotteria Melotti.</a> The second website is <a href="http://www.wearefine.com" target="_blank">FINE Design Group</a> </p>

	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>First Website.... The main focal point is created by a full screen image of the end product. The dish is where the users eye is drawn to by blurring out the outer edges of the photo and while the brand and interactive link are in the center. The brand and link is centered but they are not contrasting with the background so your eyes go to this second. The high quality food photography makes the user want the dish it looks inviting and makes the user curious about what the next behind the inviting interactive play button in the middle of the screen.</p>

	<p>Second Website "FINE Design Group" There are things that I like about this site and some things I don't like. I like the use of high quality images and screenshots of their works but the reason I don't is because there are too many images that feels like overstimulation and my eye doesn't seem to be able to find a natural flow of progression. I prefer sites with a sense of direction.</p>

	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p> They both use high quality images to create interest from the user which causes them to continue navigating the site. Neither seems to use much of white space. Risotto Melotti uses blurred focus techniques to direct the user's eye to the main focal point. The close ups and different angles create an interest in their farm-to-table dining. FINE Design Group doesn't use these focus techniques to direct the users eye which I feel the absence of it can make the user feel a little overwhelmed. But they also have alot of amazing works to showcase.</p>
